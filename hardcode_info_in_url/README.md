### Hardcoded information in URL

The application randomly select an ID and assigns that ID to the admin. If the player manages to hardcode the right ID the application returns the flag. However, to make it a bit more challenging the ID is randomly generated. Therefore, the player has to come up with some "bruteforce" either using python requests, the Burp Intruder or something else.
